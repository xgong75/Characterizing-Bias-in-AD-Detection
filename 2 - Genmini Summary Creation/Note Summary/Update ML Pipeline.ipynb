Anterior brushing samples of the urothelial \\nmass was also obtained during the procedure for cytology \\nanalysis. Patient's kidney function continuously improved with \\ndrainage by the perc nephrostomy tube and Cr 8.1-->6.7 (on day \\nof discharge). Per ___, patient should follow-up in 3 months for \\nremoval of perc nephrostomy tube. From complications of \\nobstructive uropathy, patient developed hyperkalemia and \\nhyperphosphatemia. Renal was consulted and recommended Na \\nbicarb, sevelamir and outpatient follow-up as there is no acute \\nindication for HD. Due to hyperkalemia, patient's Lasix was \\nincreased to 40mg daily upon discharge. For worsening anemia \\nlikely ___ CKD and continuous bleed from the urothelial \\ncarcinoma, patient received 2 U PRBC during this hospitalization \\nand may be transfusion dependent in the near future.

You were admitted to the hospital after you \\npresented with right sided flank pain. We found that your kidney \\nmass is causing obstruction of your urine, and the backup of \\nurine is causing elevated pressures within the kidney. This is \\nthe reason for your severe back pain. The interventional \\nradiology team evaluated you and placed a tube through your back \\nin order to drain the urine. Afterward, your kidney function \\ncontinued to improve but due to the long term obstruction, much \\nof the damage may be permanent. Due to your kidney injury, your \\npotassium levels are high. You will need to take Lasix 40mg \\ndaily in order to keep the potassium level at a normal level.  \\n\\nThe interventional radiology team recommended that you follow-up \\nwith them in 3 months to remove the kidney tube. You will also \\nfollow-up with the kidney doctors in the outpatient setting to \\nevaluate how your kidney improves over time. Like we discussed, \\nthere is a chance that you will need to be on dialysis in the \\nfuture. You will follow-up with transplant surgery for an \\nevaluation to discuss your fistula graft procedure, which will \\noccur on ___.\\n\\nA sample of the urothelial mass showed that it was cancer.

Patient was deemed competent to make medical decisions and left the hospital against medical advice.\\n* **Chronic Renal Failure:** Patient presented with subacute decline in renal function. This was likely due to the right ureteral mass and hydronephrosis, as well as pre-renal etiology due to poor oral intake. Patient declined IV fluids, nephrostomy tube, and brush biopsy. Patient left against medical advice.\\n* **Hyperkalemia:** Patient had hyperkalemia likely due to renal failure. Potassium peaked at 6.7. Patient received dextrose, insulin, calcium carbonate, kayxelate, and IV lasix. Potassium improved to 4.1 prior to leaving against medical advice.\\n* **Right Ureteral Mass:** Patient had a right ureteral mass with right hydronephrosis and worsening renal function. Perc nephrostomy and brush biopsy were recommended, but patient declined and left against medical advice.\\n* **Anemia:** Patient was anemic likely due to CKD.

Atrial fibrillation \\nwith slow ventricular response.  Compared to tracing #1 \\nventricular response has further slowed to a rate in the \\nthirties. \\nTRACING #2 \\n\\nCXR on admission (portable): IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly without \\novert CHF. Two areas of opacity in the right upper and lower \\nlung could represent pneumonia, though followup to resolution is \\nadvised to exclude underlying pulmonary nodules. \\n  \\nPlease note at the time of followup, if possible, a dedicated PA \\nand lateral view of the chest would be recommended to more \\nthoroughly assess.\\n\\nCXR on admission (PA/Lat): Compared to the film from the prior \\nday, there is no significant interval change. The previously \\ndescribed ill-defined opacities are not as apparent on today's \\nstudy. \\n \\nCXR s/p PPM: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of ___, there \\nhas been placement of a pacemaker device with single lead \\nextending to the region of the apex of the right ventricle. \\nSubstantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with \\nrelatively normal pulmonary vessels, raising the possibility of \\ncardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion. \\n\\nEcho: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial \\nmass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal \\nechocardiography). The right atrium is moderately dilated. The \\nestimated right atrial pressure is ___. Left ventricular \\nwall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic \\nfunction are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is \\ndilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending \\naorta is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve \\nleaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not \\npresent. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve \\nleaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve \\nprolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic \\nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \\n\\nIMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity dilation with free wall \\nhypokinesis. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Normal left \\nventricular cavity size with preserved global and regional \\nsystolic function.\\n\\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: \\nBased on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the \\necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical \\ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on \\nclinical and echocardiographic data.  \\n\\nMRSA SCREEN (Final ___:    No MRSA isolated.  \\n\\n \\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nPatient is a ___ yo male sent in from rehab for pacemaker \\nevaluation given pauses of ___ seconds on holter presenting with \\nhypothermia and bradycardia, CXR suspicious for pneumonia.  We \\nalso must consider health care associated pneumonia in this \\npatient given recent hospitalization and hypothermia. \\n.\\n#.Hypothermia/Possible Hospital Acquired Pneumonia: patient \\npresented to the hospital in a state of mild hypothermia, which \\nwas concerning for infection.  Chest X-ray could not rule out \\npneumonia, and the patient was started on vancomycin and \\ncefepime empirically on the day of admission.  Sputum samples \\nwere obtained, and two came back with signs of contamination.  \\nDuring hospitalization, thyroid function tests and cortisol \\nlevels were checked and were not convincing as etiologies of his \\nhypothermia.  MRSA screen was performed and showed no growth.  \\nBlood cultures showed no growth.  Patient was taken off \\nvancomycin and cefepime due to this and will be d/c'd on \\nlevaquin for an additional 8 days.\\n.\\n#.Bradycardia: the patient was monitored on telemetry during his \\nhospitalization.  On the night of admission, the patient had a \\nheart rate drop to as low as 19 bpm.  He was asymptomatic at \\nthis time, but was administered two doses of atropine, to which \\nhe responded.  Patient remained bradycardic, yet asymptomatic, \\nfor the majority of time until his PPM placement on ___ when \\nhe maintained a paced rate of 60 bpm.  His pacemaker was \\ninterrogated on ___, and CXR revealed no abnormalities in \\nPPM placement.  \\n.\\n#.Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure:  when patient \\narrived to ___, his chest X-ray showed no signs of volume \\noverload.   His overall volume status was difficult to assess \\nbased on the elephantiasis verrucosa nostra present bilaterally \\non his legs.  The patient recently had an episode of renal \\nfailure and hypotension, so IV diuresis was not employed during \\nthe ___ hospital stay.  The patient was started on his \\nhome dose of 40 mg Lasix PO daily.  Daily weights and ins and \\nouts were recorded throughout hospitalization, and BUN and \\ncreatinine were trended.  The patient is not on an ACE inhibitor \\nor beta blocker for his diastolic heart failure.  Echocardiogram \\nreports were not available for the patient, so ejection fraction \\nwas not known on admission.  LVEF was >55% on this admission.\\n.\\n#.Atrial fibrillation: the patient was found to be in atrial \\nfibrillation during his stay.  The patient is not on rate \\ncontrol due to his bradycardia.  His coumadin dose was held in \\nanticipation of permanent pacemaker placement.  It was restarted \\nafter the procedure.  The patient was not symptomatic at any \\ntime during hospitalization.  INR upon discharge was 1.7 and \\nshould be followed up at the extended care facility to assess \\nfor therapeutic levels.\\n.\\n#.Elevated TSH:  the patient was noted to have an elevated TSH \\nduring hospitalization.  Free T4, T4 and T3 levels were checked \\nand were normal.  This finding likely represents subclinical \\nhypothyroidism, and the patient was not started on replacement \\ntherapy.  His primary care provider should follow up this issue \\nwith him on an outpatient basis.\\n.\\n#.Thrombocytopenia: patient had progressive thrombocytopenia \\nduring course of admission from 288 to 140s.  He has been on \\nheparin SC during admission.  4 T's were calculated and patient \\nonly had one (>50% drop in platelets), total score of 3.  He had \\nno evidence of thrombosis or skin reactions during admission, \\nand the drop in platelets occurred within 10 days, but patient \\nwas hospitalized recently with probable heparin exposure.  \\nPatient was not worked up for HITT.  Platelet count increased on \\nthe day of admission from 145 to 163.  Patient is currently \\nbeing treated with coumadin and is currently subtherapeutic.  \\nPossible other causes of thrombocytopenia include antibiotics \\nthat he was on during admission.  Platelet count should be \\ntrended at extended care facility.\\n.\\n#.Elephantiasis verrucosa nostra: the patient has end-stage \\nchronic venous stasis changes in legs bilaterally with \\nlymphedematous changes and verrucous appearance.  Wound care \\nconsult was obtained and legs were wrapped during most of \\nhospitalization with an order to apply mupirocin cream in \\nbetween skin cracks to prevent introduction of bacteria.  \\nPatient also has been prescribed fluocinonide cream to apply to \\nthe legs.\\n.\\n#.Obstructive sleep apnea: the patient refused to wear CPAP \\nduring hospitalization.  He was placed on nasal cannula during \\nthe night (and most times during the day) to give him some \\noxygen flow while sleeping.  Please encourage to use CPAP or \\nplace on BIPAP while sleeping.\\n.\\n#.Benign prostatic hyperplasia: the patient was continued on his \\nhome dose of finasteride during his hospitalization, and was \\ndischarged on the same regimen.\\n.\\n#.Possible pulmonary nodules: on portable CXR on admission, \\nthere were noted to be opacities which could represent nodules.  \\nFurther PA/lateral X-rays did not show this however.  An X-ray \\nshould be obtained at a later date by the patient's PCP to \\nfollow up this possible abnormality.\\n.\\n#.Hypertension: patient has been discharged on home regimen.  \\nThere were no problems with hypertension during hospital course.\\n.\\n#.Asthma: patient was provided home medications as well as \\nnebulizer treatment while hospitalized.  He is being discharged \\non his home regimen.\\n \\nMedications on Admission:\\nCalcium 600mg BID  \\nCombivent 2 puffs q 6h  \\nCipro 500mg for prophylaxis MWF  \\nFerrous Gluconate 300 TID  \\nFinasteride 5mg QD  \\nFluticasone 110mcg 2 puffs BID  \\nFluocinonide 0.05% Cream 1 Appl TP BID apply to affected areas  \\nHydrocodone-Acetaminophen 1 TAB PO Q4H:PRN pain  \\nLidocaine 5% Patch 1 PTCH TD DAILY  \\nOmeprazole 20 mg PO BID  \\nSimvastatin 10 mg PO/NG DAILY  \\nLasix 40mg PO daily  \\nVitamin D 400 UNIT PO/NG BID \\n \\nDischarge Medications:\\n1.

CXR was without focal \\ninfiltrate.  BNP somewhat elevated, so could also have a \\ncomponent of heart failure.  Given his initial hypothermia, \\nlasix was held.  He was continued on his home Fluticasone 110 \\nmcg 2 Puffs bid and placed on standing atrovent and albuterol \\nnebs.  He had received 60 mg of prednisone in the ED, however \\ndue to hypothermia and concern for infection further steroids \\nwere held.  Over his hospital admission his dyspnea and wheezing \\nresolved.  He then had crackles and was restarted on his home \\nlasix dose.\\n\\n# Hypothermia:  Patient was hypothermic to 92 on arrival to the \\nfloor, but otherwise looked well.  Due to concern for infection \\nblood cultures were sent and he was started on vanc (to cover \\nskin flora) and levofloxacin (to cover possible PNA).  A Bair \\nhugger was used to warm him.  TSH was mildly elevated, but free \\nT4 was normal.  Given the prednisone in the ED, am cortisol was \\ndifficult to interpret.  A UA was checked which was consistent \\nwith infection, however he denied any urinary symptoms and his \\nurine culture was contaminated.  After two days of negative \\ncultures vancomycin was stopped.  His temperature ran on the \\nlowish side, but he did not become frankly hypothermic again. He \\nwas placed on levoquin to complete a ___nd then \\nshould be switched back on ciprofloxacin three times weekly to \\nprevent his skin infections.\\n\\n#  ___:  Cr increased to 1.4 from 1.1 with institution of his \\nhome lasix dose.  Most likely from adding back the lasix, but \\ncould also be from other causes of ___.  By time of discharge \\nhis creatinine was 1.3 and we feel his lasix should be continued \\nto help with his leg edema. He should have his creatinine and \\nelectrolytes checked with his INR check in the next ___ days to \\nensure it remains stable (1.1-1.4) and he does not need further \\nKCL repletion.\\n\\n#  Hypertension/ Diastolic CHF: Only on lasix as an outpatient \\nand normotensive here.  In the setting of hypothermia lasix was \\ninitially held.  It was later restarted at his home dose as \\nabove.\\n\\n#  Supratherapeutic INR/Atrial fibrillation:  Patient is on \\ncoumadin for atrial fibrillation.  EKG showed atrial pacing.  No \\nclinical evidence of bleeding.  Coumadin was held while INR > 3 \\nand on discharge his INR was 3.2 so coumadin was not \\nre-intiated. He should have an INR checked in ___ days and the \\nresults faxed to the physician on call at the rehab to ascertain \\nhis coumadin dosing.\\n.\\nInactive issues:\\n#  Pancytopenia: Appears to be chronic.  \\n  \\n#  Hyperlipidemia:  The patient was continued on simvastatin.\\n\\n#  BPH: The patient was continued on Finasteride.\\n \\n#  Depression: The patient was continued on zoloft.\\n\\n#  Patient is on Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO ___, \\n___ for ppx of infection of his leg.

Given how diffuse they \\nwere, flat troponins, and quick resolution, demand ischemia is \\nimore likely, but worsening CAD in proximal LAD distribution \\ncannot be excluded. Currently on ASA/plavix and stable. Risk of \\nheparin outweighs benefit with hematoma. Recurrent chest pian \\nhere that is different, likely non-anginal. Nuclear stress test \\ntoday demonstrated no change since ___. Catheterization is high \\nrisk if no recurrence of chest pain given CKD, and transient \\nnature of pain; but balanced ischemia could be missed  \\n-cont ASA, plavix. No heparin gtt for now  \\n-Her more common chest pain occurred the second night of \\nadmission, woke her up from sleep, no EKG changes, and troponins \\nremained flat. It resolved with nitroglycerin. Therefore, this \\npain may not be anginal in nature.\\n#Vasovagal syncope on ___: unclear but concerning for possible \\nseizure, despite no h/o seizure and more plausible explanation \\nof syncope in setting of R hip hematoma and some blood \\nsequestration. Seizure, however, is very unlikely given her \\nprodrome, that both arms and and legs were jerking and she was \\nstill talking. Head CT ordered, read was negative.

Hospital course \\ncomplicated by fevers, rash, acute on chronic renal failure.\\n\\n# Dyspnea and cough \\nInitially though to be ___ acute on chronic diastolic heart \\nfailure and began IV diuresis. TTE showed EF 66% and mild \\nvalvular disease with an elevated CI. No clear evidence of high \\noutput failure. Diuresis was limited by episode of severe \\nhypotension (SBP ___ with syncope and renal failure. Dyspnea \\nand cough improved after diruesis. CXR did not show any evidence \\nof PNA. Ultimately symptoms may have been more infectious than \\nCHF related given that patient received fluids and symptoms did \\nnot return. Diuretic (torsemide) held upon discharge, see below. \\n\\n\\n# Fevers, Rigors, Sweats\\n# Elevated CRP\\nPatient presented from home with rigors and had a documented \\nfever while hospitalized to ___. She also had a couple of \\nepisodes of NS while admitted. These symptoms quickly dissipated \\nafter admission. Blood cultures were negative (though were never \\ntaken at time of sweats or fever). Urine culture was also \\nnegative. Lyme serologies were negative. TTE showed mild \\nvalvular abnormalities. ID was consulted for yield of ___ in the \\ndiagnosis of culture negative endocarditis. Given that pre-test \\nprobability was low, TEE was deferred. CRP was checked as part \\nof this work-up and was remarkably elevated to ~250. Without \\nintervention, CRP improved to 144 at discharge. She will likely \\nneed further trending of this. She did not receive antibiotics \\nwhile admitted. She did have PMR treated with steroids prior to \\nadmission however she had no symptoms of PMR. \\n\\n# Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient's baseline Cr was \\n1.4-1.6. After diuresis, Cr jumped from 1.4 to 2.4. Improved \\ninitially with IV hydration and then with PO hydration. Patient \\nwas encouraged to main a 1.5L-2.0L oral intake at discharge. She \\nwill need repeat labs drawn to ensure that Cr returns back to \\nbaseline as it was 1.9 at discharge. Torsemide and valsartan \\nwere held at discharge.\\n\\n# Labile hypertension\\n# Episode of hypotension and syncope\\nPatient experienced wild swings in BP with an associated episode \\nof hypotension with syncope to SBP of 70. Medications were \\nadjusted and she was maintained on carvedilol and imdur for 72+ \\nhours with SBPs ranging from 130-160. This was discussed with \\nher PCP who agreed in keeping her BP in this range. Valsartan \\nwas held at discharge. She was advised to take BP twice daily \\nbefore medications and to hold BP meds if SBP < 120.\\n\\n# Dysphagia: Patient complained of esophageal dysphagia \\nsymptoms. Tertiary contractions seen on barium swallow which may \\nbe cause of dysphagia and commonly seen in presbyesophagus. \\nAdvised that patient need slowly. No webs/strictures seen. \\nFurther work-up with endoscopy was deferred. \\n\\n# Rash: Patient had faint erythemaous rash on her arm, lower \\nabdomen and left breast which improved without intervention. \\n?Viral exanthem. Will need outpatient follow up if rash \\npersists.  \\n\\nChronic Medical Problems \\n. GERD: continued on omeprazole.\\n\\nTransitional Issues:\\n1. Monitor Cr in coming week\\n2. Trend CRP\\n3.

Imaging\\nsignificant for L ___ rib fractures, no other injuries\\nidentified on CT head, CT neck, or CT chest. Pt transferred to\\n___ for further management. Pt does not exactly recall the\\nevents of the fall, only that she believes she tripped. History\\nis limited by patient's cognitive status however per her \\ndaughter\\nwho talked with her immediately after the fall reports that the\\npatient had her breakfast, was opening the shades (around 8:00\\nAM) in her kitchen and turned around. She then reported falling\\nforward but symptoms preceding the fall are unclear. Medicine\\nconsulted for further work-up of etiology of fall. Per medicine,\\nfall is very suspicious for mechanical fall however cannot fully\\nexclude syncope given her underlying cognitive impairment and inability to\\ngive a clear story. Review of her telemetry shows normal sinus\\nrhythm without any concerning arrhythmias. While she does have a\\nsoft systolic murmur, it is not consistent with severe AS, and\\nthus a TTE is not indicated as an inpatient. After it was deemed \\nthat no acute surgical intervention would be performed, the \\npatient was transferred to medicine for further management. \\n\\n**Past Medical History:**\\nPast Medical/Surgical History: \\nDepression\\nCognitive impairment\\nPolyneuropathy\\nBilateral hearing loss\\nOsteopenia\\nHypertension\\nGeneralized anxiety disorder\\nHistory of breast cancer status post lumpectomy and XRT ___,\\nrecurrence status post left mastectomy in ___\\n___ syndrome \\n\\n**Social History:**\",\n          \"## Masked and Summarized Notes:\\n\\n**Note 1:**\\n\\n**Patient:**  ___\\n**Service:** MEDICINE\\n**Chief Complaint:** Dyspnea on exertion\\n**Major Procedure:** ___: TAVR\\n\\n**Summary:** \\nThis is the admission note for a female patient presenting for elective TAVR.

Imaging\\nsignificant for L ___ rib fractures, no other injuries\\nidentified on CT head, CT neck, or CT chest. Pt transferred to\\n___ for further management. Pt does not exactly recall the\\nevents of the fall, only that she believes she tripped. History\\nis limited by patient's cognitive status however per her \\ndaughter\\nwho talked with her immediately after the fall reports that the\\npatient had her breakfast, was opening the shades (around 8:00\\nAM) in her kitchen and turned around. She then reported falling\\nforward but symptoms preceding the fall are unclear. Medicine\\nconsulted for further work-up of etiology of fall. Per medicine,\\nfall is very suspicious for mechanical fall however cannot fully\\nexclude syncope given her underlying cognitive impairment and inability to\\ngive a clear story. Review of her telemetry shows normal sinus\\nrhythm without any concerning arrhythmias. While she does have a\\nsoft systolic murmur, it is not consistent with severe AS, and\\nthus a TTE is not indicated as an inpatient. After it was deemed \\nthat no acute surgical intervention would be performed, the \\npatient was transferred to medicine for further management. \\n\\n**Past Medical History:**\\nPast Medical/Surgical History: \\nDepression\\nCognitive impairment\\nPolyneuropathy\\nBilateral hearing loss\\nOsteopenia\\nHypertension\\nGeneralized anxiety disorder\\nHistory of breast cancer status post lumpectomy and XRT ___,\\nrecurrence status post left mastectomy in ___\\n___ syndrome \\n\\n**Social History:**\",\n          \"## Masked and Summarized Notes:\\n\\n**Note 1:**\\n\\n**Patient:**  ___\\n**Service:** MEDICINE\\n**Chief Complaint:** Dyspnea on exertion\\n**Major Procedure:** ___: TAVR\\n\\n**Summary:** \\nThis is the admission note for a female patient presenting for elective TAVR. She has a history of CAD, HTN, DM2, and severe AS. Her symptoms include worsening fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. She also reports epigastric pain that is worse with breathing in and possibly associated with exertion.

She is now presenting with recurrent aphasia, slurred speech, and right facial droop. These symptoms have been fluctuating since her discharge. Her CT and CTA head show evolving infarcts within the L MCA distribution and a calcification in the L M1 branch. She is being considered for embolectomy. \\n\\n**Note 3:**\\n\\n**Examination:** CHEST (PRE-OP PA AND LAT)\\n**Indication:** Pre-op evaluation for a patient with severe aortic stenosis\\n\\n**Summary:** \\nThis is a chest X-ray report for a patient undergoing TAVR. There are no prior chest radiographs available for comparison. The report notes two regions of peribronchovascular opacification, which could be atelectasis, but further clinical assessment is recommended to rule out pneumonia. There is no pulmonary edema. The heart is normal size. Atherosclerotic calcification is heavy in the aorta and origin of head neck vessels. \\n\\n**Note 4:**\\n\\n**Examination:** ART DUP EXT LO UNI;F/U RIGHT\\n**Indication:** Right groin evaluation for pseudoaneurysm in a patient with AS s/p TAVR\\n\\n**Summary:** \\nThis is a right femoral ultrasound report for a patient with AS s/p TAVR who has a bruit and decreased DP pulse.
